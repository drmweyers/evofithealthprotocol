## 🏗️ **Architecture Review**

### **Database Design:**
```sql
personalizedMealPlans:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- customerId (UUID, Foreign Key -> users.id)
- trainerId (UUID, Foreign Key -> users.id) 
- mealPlanData (JSONB, Complete meal plan snapshot)
- assignedAt (Timestamp, Default: now())
```

**✅ Strengths:**
- Proper foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
- JSONB storage preserves assignment-time meal plan data
- Indexed relationships for efficient queries
- Clean separation of concerns

### **API Layer:**
**Trainer Routes:**
- `GET /api/trainer/customers/:customerId/meal-plans` - View customer plans
- `POST /api/trainer/customers/:customerId/meal-plans` - Assign new plan
- `DELETE /api/trainer/meal-plans/:planId` - Remove specific plan

**Customer Routes:**
- `GET /api/meal-plan/personalized` - Access assigned plans

**✅ Strengths:**
- RESTful design principles
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Role-based authorization middleware
- Comprehensive error handling

### **Frontend Integration:**
**Customer Interface (`Customer.tsx`):**
- React Query for state management
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Responsive grid layout
- Modal detail views

**✅ Strengths:**
- Clean component architecture
- Proper state management
- Excellent user experience
