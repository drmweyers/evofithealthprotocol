## 🔍 INCIDENT DETECTION & IDENTIFICATION

### Detection Sources

#### Automated Monitoring
- Application security logs
- Database connection failures
- Rate limiting threshold breaches
- Authentication failure patterns
- File upload anomalies
- API endpoint abuse patterns

#### Manual Reporting
- User reports of suspicious activity
- Developer identification during code review
- Security audit findings
- Third-party security research
- Penetration testing results

### Initial Assessment Checklist

#### Information Gathering
- [ ] What type of incident is suspected?
- [ ] When was the incident first detected?
- [ ] What systems or data are potentially affected?
- [ ] Is the incident ongoing or contained?
- [ ] What is the potential business impact?
- [ ] Are there regulatory notification requirements?

#### Evidence Preservation
- [ ] Preserve system logs immediately
- [ ] Take screenshots of relevant error messages
- [ ] Document timeline of events
- [ ] Identify affected user accounts
- [ ] Preserve network traffic logs if available

## 🛡️ CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES

### Immediate Containment (< 15 minutes)

#### For Authentication Breaches
```bash
# Emergency user account lockout
AFFECTED_USER_ID="user_123"
echo "UPDATE users SET is_locked = true WHERE id = '$AFFECTED_USER_ID'" | psql $DATABASE_URL

# Revoke all active sessions for user
DELETE FROM refresh_tokens WHERE user_id = '$AFFECTED_USER_ID';
```

#### For System Compromise
```bash
# Emergency application shutdown
docker-compose --profile prod down

# Isolate database connections
# Change database password immediately
# Block suspicious IP addresses at firewall level
```

#### For Data Exposure
- Immediately assess scope of exposed data
- Identify affected users/records
- Determine if PHI/health data is involved
- Begin user notification planning

### Short-term Containment (< 1 hour)

#### Network-Level Protection
```bash
# Block malicious IP addresses
iptables -A INPUT -s MALICIOUS_IP -j DROP

# Implement emergency rate limiting
# Reduce API rate limits to minimal levels
# Enable enhanced logging
```

#### Application-Level Controls
```typescript
// Emergency security mode activation
const EMERGENCY_MODE = {
  enableStrictRateLimit: true,
  requireReauthentication: true,
  logAllRequests: true,
  blockNewRegistrations: true
};
```

### Long-term Containment (< 4 hours)

#### System Hardening
- Apply emergency security patches
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Strengthen authentication requirements
- Implement additional input validation
- Enable enhanced monitoring

---

## 🔧 ERADICATION & RECOVERY

### Eradication Process

#### Vulnerability Analysis
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify how the incident occurred
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Scan for similar vulnerabilities
3. **Code Review**: Examine related code for security issues
4. **Configuration Review**: Check security configurations

#### Remediation Actions
```bash
# Update vulnerable packages
npm audit fix --force
npm update

# Apply security patches
git apply security-patches/*.patch

# Update security configurations
cp .env.security.template .env.production
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### System Restoration
1. **Backup Verification**: Ensure clean backup availability
2. **Staged Recovery**: Restore systems in controlled environment
3. **Security Testing**: Verify vulnerabilities are resolved
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during recovery

#### Service Restoration Checklist
- [ ] Database integrity verified
- [ ] Application security tests passed
- [ ] Authentication system functioning correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting properly configured
- [ ] Security headers properly set
- [ ] Logging and monitoring active
- [ ] User access controls verified

---

## 📊 MONITORING & VALIDATION

### Post-Incident Monitoring

#### Enhanced Surveillance (48-72 hours)
```typescript
// Implement enhanced logging
const ENHANCED_MONITORING = {
  logAllAuthAttempts: true,
  logAllDatabaseQueries: true,
  logAllFileUploads: true,
  alertOnAnomalies: true,
  increaseLogRetention: '30d'
};
```

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Authentication success/failure rates
- API endpoint access patterns
- Database query patterns
- File upload activities
- Error rates by endpoint
- Response time anomalies

### Validation Testing
