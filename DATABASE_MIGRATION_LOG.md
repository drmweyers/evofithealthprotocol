ALTER TABLE "protocol_assignments" ADD CONSTRAINT "protocol_assignments_protocol_id_trainer_health_protocols_id_fk" 
    FOREIGN KEY ("protocol_id") REFERENCES "trainer_health_protocols"("id") ON DELETE cascade;

ALTER TABLE "protocol_assignments" ADD CONSTRAINT "protocol_assignments_customer_id_users_id_fk" 
    FOREIGN KEY ("customer_id") REFERENCES "users"("id") ON DELETE cascade;

ALTER TABLE "protocol_assignments" ADD CONSTRAINT "protocol_assignments_trainer_id_users_id_fk" 
    FOREIGN KEY ("trainer_id") REFERENCES "users"("id") ON DELETE cascade;
```

#### Phase 6: Index Creation
**Action**: Add performance indexes for health protocol tables.

**Indexes Added**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX "trainer_health_protocols_trainer_id_idx" ON "trainer_health_protocols" ("trainer_id");
CREATE INDEX "trainer_health_protocols_type_idx" ON "trainer_health_protocols" ("type");
CREATE INDEX "protocol_assignments_protocol_id_idx" ON "protocol_assignments" ("protocol_id");
CREATE INDEX "protocol_assignments_customer_id_idx" ON "protocol_assignments" ("customer_id");
CREATE INDEX "protocol_assignments_trainer_id_idx" ON "protocol_assignments" ("trainer_id");
CREATE INDEX "protocol_assignments_status_idx" ON "protocol_assignments" ("status");
```

## Migration Safety & Rollback

### Safety Measures Implemented
1. **Cascade Deletions**: All foreign key constraints use `ON DELETE CASCADE`
2. **IF EXISTS Checks**: Migration uses `IF EXISTS` to prevent errors
3. **Ordered Operations**: Dependencies handled in correct order
4. **Transaction Safety**: Migration can be run in a transaction

### Rollback Instructions
**⚠️ WARNING**: Rollback will result in permanent data loss of any health protocols created after migration.

**Recommended Approach**: Database backup restoration

**Manual Rollback** (if backup not available):
1. Run previous migrations in reverse order:
   - `0003_create_personalized_meal_plans.sql`
   - `0002_create_personalized_recipes.sql`  
   - `0001_tricky_king_cobra.sql` (meal plan portions)
   - `0000_left_crusher_hogan.sql` (recipes table)

2. Remove health protocol tables:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE "protocol_assignments" CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE "trainer_health_protocols" CASCADE;
   ```

### Backup Recommendations
- **Pre-Migration**: Full database backup required
- **Post-Migration**: Backup after successful migration
- **Retention**: Keep pre-migration backup for 30 days minimum
