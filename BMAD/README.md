## 🚀 What is BMAD?

BMAD is a revolutionary framework that transforms how AI agents collaborate on software development projects. It provides:

### Two-Phase Development Process
1. **Agentic Planning Phase** - Specialized agents create comprehensive documentation
2. **Context-Engineered Development** - Story-driven implementation with full context

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has a specific role and expertise
- **Coordinated Workflow**: Agents work together seamlessly
- **Context Preservation**: All decisions and knowledge are documented
