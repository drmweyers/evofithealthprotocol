## Phase 2: Performance Optimization

### Resource Usage Optimization

**Current Performance Metrics:**

```
Container                    CPU%     Memory Usage    Status
evofithealthprotocol-dev    0.32%    249.6MiB       Optimal
evofithealthprotocol-postgres 3.69%  21.04MiB       Excellent
```

**Optimization Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Memory usage well below capacity (< 1% for both containers)
- ‚úÖ CPU usage minimal during normal operations
- ‚úÖ Fast startup time achieved (< 30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Efficient resource allocation

**Performance Recommendations:**
1. **Continue current resource allocation** - metrics are optimal
2. **Implement container resource limits** for production deployment
3. **Monitor during load testing** to establish baseline performance
4. **Consider horizontal scaling** for production traffic

### Application Performance Issues Identified

**üö® Critical Issues Found:**
- Missing authentication components (`Login.tsx`, `useAuth` hook)
- Import resolution errors causing application startup failures
- Frontend compilation errors preventing proper functionality

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Restore missing authentication components
2. Fix import path resolution in Vite configuration
3. Verify all component dependencies are present

## Phase 3: Security Hardening

### Security Assessment

**üî¥ High Priority Security Issues:**

1. **Container Root User Execution**
   - **Risk:** High
   - **Current:** Running as root in development containers
   - **Recommendation:** Implement non-root user in Dockerfile
   - **Impact:** Reduces container escape attack surface

2. **Default Database Credentials**
   - **Risk:** Medium
   - **Current:** Using default postgres/postgres credentials
   - **Recommendation:** Use environment-specific strong passwords
   - **Impact:** Prevents unauthorized database access

3. **Environment Variable Exposure**
   - **Risk:** Medium
   - **Current:** Sensitive keys visible in docker-compose config
   - **Recommendation:** Use Docker secrets for production
   - **Impact:** Protects API keys and secrets

**‚úÖ Security Strengths:**
- Health checks implemented for database container
- Proper network isolation between services
- No exposed unnecessary ports
- Environment variable management in place

### Security Hardening Recommendations

1. **Immediate (High Priority):**
   ```dockerfile
   # Add to Dockerfile
   RUN adduser -D -s /bin/sh appuser
   USER appuser
   ```

2. **Short Term:**
   - Implement Docker secrets for production
   - Update default database credentials
   - Add container resource limits
   - Implement proper SSL/TLS certificates

3. **Long Term:**
   - Regular security scanning with tools like Trivy
   - Implement container signing and verification
   - Add runtime security monitoring
