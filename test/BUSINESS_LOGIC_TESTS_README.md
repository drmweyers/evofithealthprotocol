## 🔧 Test Account Credentials

The tests use these pre-configured accounts:

```javascript
const TEST_ACCOUNTS = {
  admin: {
    email: 'admin@fitmeal.pro',
    password: 'Admin123!@#'
  },
  trainer: {
    email: 'testtrainer@example.com', 
    password: 'TrainerPassword123!'
  },
  customer: {
    email: 'testcustomer@example.com',
    password: 'TestPassword123!'
  }
};
```

## 🎨 Visual Test Features

The Playwright tests include:
- **Real-time visual feedback** - On-screen test progress indicators
- **Color-coded status** - Green for success, red for failure, orange for warnings
- **Step-by-step execution** - Clear visual progression through test steps
- **Console logging** - Detailed output for debugging
- **Screenshots on failure** - Automatic capture for troubleshooting
- **Video recording** - Complete test execution recordings

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Sequential Multi-Role Login** - Testing multiple role logins in the same browser context can cause session conflicts
2. **Invitation Endpoint** - `/api/invitations` returns 404 (may not be implemented)
3. **Title Matching** - App title is "EvoFitMeals" not "FitnessMealPlanner"

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Expand API Tests** - Add more endpoint coverage
2. **Add Performance Tests** - Load testing for authentication endpoints
3. **Database Isolation** - Separate test database for consistent results
4. **CI/CD Integration** - Automated test runs on deployment

### For Development
1. **Regular Test Runs** - Execute tests after major changes
2. **New Feature Testing** - Add tests for new business logic
3. **Security Testing** - Regular validation of permission boundaries
4. **User Acceptance Testing** - Validate against business requirements
