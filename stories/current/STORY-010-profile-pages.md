## 📋 Story Overview

### Problem Statement
Users need dedicated profile pages to view and manage their personal information, see their assigned trainers (for customers), view their clients (for trainers), and access their account settings. The profile functionality was previously incomplete and required proper implementation across all user roles.

### Business Value
- **User Experience**: Provides centralized location for user information and settings
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Customers can easily see their assigned trainer's information
- **Trainer Efficiency**: Trainers can quickly access their client list and statistics
- **Admin Control**: Admins can manage their profile and system settings

### Success Criteria
✅ Profile navigation button in header for all user roles  
✅ Role-based profile pages (Admin, Trainer, Customer)  
✅ Customer profile displays linked trainer information  
✅ API endpoints for all profile data retrieval  
✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop  
✅ Proper authentication and authorization checks

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Components Created

#### AdminProfile.tsx
```typescript
// Profile page for admin users with system statistics
interface AdminProfileProps {
  user: AdminUser
  systemStats: SystemStatistics
  recentActivity: ActivityLog[]
}
```

#### TrainerProfile.tsx
```typescript
// Profile page for trainers showing clients and protocols
interface TrainerProfileProps {
  user: TrainerUser
  clients: Customer[]
  protocols: HealthProtocol[]
  stats: TrainerStatistics
}
```

#### CustomerProfile.tsx
```typescript
// Profile page for customers with trainer linkage
interface CustomerProfileProps {
  user: CustomerUser
  trainer?: TrainerInfo
  protocols: ProtocolAssignment[]
  progress: ProgressMetrics
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints Created

```typescript
// Admin profile endpoint
GET /api/admin/profile
Response: {
  profile: AdminProfile,
  systemStats: SystemStatistics
}

// Trainer profile endpoint  
GET /api/trainer/profile
Response: {
  profile: TrainerProfile,
  clients: Customer[],
  stats: TrainerStatistics
}

// Customer profile endpoint
GET /api/customer/profile
Response: {
  profile: CustomerProfile,
  trainer?: TrainerInfo,
  stats: CustomerStatistics
}
```

### 3. Navigation Updates

**ResponsiveHeader.tsx**
- Added Profile button for all authenticated users
- Role-based routing to appropriate profile page
- Consistent placement across all pages

**App.tsx Routes**
```typescript
<Route path="/admin/profile" element={<AdminProfile />} />
<Route path="/trainer/profile" element={<TrainerProfile />} />
<Route path="/customer/profile" element={<CustomerProfile />} />
```

### 4. Customer-Trainer Linkage
- Fixed Drizzle ORM join operation (see STORY-009)
- Displays trainer information when protocol is assigned
- Graceful handling of unassigned customers
