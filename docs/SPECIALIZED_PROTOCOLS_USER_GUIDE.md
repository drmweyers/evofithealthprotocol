## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **General Questions**

**Q: Are these protocols safe for everyone?**
A: No. These protocols are not suitable for pregnant women, children under 18, or people with certain medical conditions. Medical consultation is always required before starting.

**Q: How long before I see results?**
A: Results vary greatly by individual, protocol type, and starting health status. Some people notice energy changes within days, while others may need weeks or months to see significant benefits.

**Q: Can I use multiple protocols at the same time?**
A: Generally not recommended, especially for beginners. Start with one protocol, complete it successfully, then consider others with medical guidance.

**Q: What if I have an adverse reaction?**
A: Stop the protocol immediately and contact your healthcare provider. For severe symptoms, seek emergency medical care.

### **Longevity Mode Questions**

**Q: Is intermittent fasting safe for everyone?**
A: No. People with diabetes, eating disorders, pregnancy, or certain medical conditions should not fast without medical supervision.

**Q: Can I exercise during longevity protocols?**
A: Light to moderate exercise is usually fine and beneficial. Intense exercise may need to be reduced during caloric restriction phases.

**Q: What if I feel weak or dizzy during fasting?**
A: This may be normal initially but stop fasting if symptoms are severe or concerning. Stay hydrated and consider breaking your fast early if needed.

### **Parasite Cleanse Questions**

**Q: How do I know if I have parasites?**
A: Proper diagnosis requires medical testing. Don't assume you have parasites based on symptoms alone. Consult a healthcare provider for testing if concerned.

**Q: Are the herbal supplements necessary?**
A: No. The food-based approach can be effective alone. Herbal supplements are optional and require medical supervision.

**Q: What are "die-off" symptoms?**
A: Some people report feeling worse initially during cleanses, attributed to toxin release. However, severe symptoms should never be ignored or assumed to be "normal die-off."

**Q: Can I do a cleanse if I'm vegetarian/vegan?**
A: Yes, the protocols can be adapted for various dietary preferences while maintaining effectiveness.

### **Health-Targeted Protocol Questions**

**Q: Will these protocols cure my condition?**
A: No. These protocols are designed to support health and potentially improve symptoms, but they do not cure diseases. Continue all prescribed medical treatments.

**Q: Can I stop my medications if I start feeling better?**
A: Never stop prescribed medications without explicit medical supervision. Dietary changes should complement, not replace, medical treatment.

**Q: How do I track if the protocol is working?**
A: Use the built-in tracking tools, monitor symptoms, energy levels, and any relevant biomarkers your doctor recommends. Regular medical check-ups are important.
