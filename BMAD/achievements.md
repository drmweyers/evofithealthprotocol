## 🎯 Success Patterns

### What Worked Well
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Specialized agents for specialized tasks
   - Parallel processing of different concerns
   - Clear handoffs between agents

2. **Incremental Debugging**
   - Fix one issue at a time
   - Validate each fix before proceeding
   - Build on successful fixes

3. **Test-Driven Discovery**
   - Use tests to explore the system
   - Let failures guide investigation
   - Convert discoveries into permanent tests

### Lessons Learned
1. **Configuration First**: Always verify basic configuration (ports, routes)
2. **UI Discovery**: Create debug tests to find UI elements
3. **Role-Based Testing**: Test each user role separately
4. **Timeout Management**: Be generous with timeouts for complex operations
