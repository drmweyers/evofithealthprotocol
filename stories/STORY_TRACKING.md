## BMAD Workflow Process

### 1. Story Creation (Scrum Master)
```bash
# Command used by SM to create story
/create-next-story
# or
/create-story --task="Task description from backlog"
```

### 2. Development Phase (Developer)
```bash
# Developer picks up story
/dev
"I'll work on the current story"

# Developer implements following story details
# All context is in the story file
```

### 3. Quality Assurance (QA Agent)
```bash
# QA validates implementation
/qa
"Validate the current story implementation"

# QA checks against acceptance criteria
# Reports any issues back to developer
```

### 4. Story Completion
```bash
# SM marks story complete
/sm
"Mark STORY-001 as complete and move to next story"

# Story moves to completed folder
# Next story becomes current
```

## Story Status Definitions

- **Backlog**: Not yet started, in priority order
- **Current**: Active development (only one at a time)
- **In Review**: Development complete, QA in progress
- **Completed**: Done and validated
- **Blocked**: Waiting on external dependency

## Story File Structure

Each story contains:
1. **Overview**: Problem, value, success criteria
2. **Technical Context**: Architecture decisions, dependencies
3. **Implementation Details**: Step-by-step guide
4. **Testing Strategy**: Test examples and approach
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Checklist for completion
6. **Definition of Done**: Clear completion requirements
7. **Risk Mitigation**: Identified risks and solutions

## Metrics and Reporting

### Current Sprint (Week of Aug 25-31)
- **Stories Planned**: 6
- **Stories Completed**: 3 (backend portions)
- **Stories In Progress**: 1 (STORY-004 frontend)
- **Velocity Trend**: Strong backend delivery, frontend integration needed

### Story Completion Times
- STORY-001: ✅ Completed (3 days - on estimate)
- STORY-002: ✅ Completed (2 days - under estimate)
- STORY-004: ✅ Backend Complete (3 days), Frontend remaining (2-3 days)
- Average: 2.7 days per story (consistent velocity)

### Story Prioritization Notes
**STORY-004 prioritized over STORY-003** based on:
- Health protocol optimization is core business value
- Email system can be addressed after authentication issues are resolved
- Protocol generation improvements will benefit all trainers immediately
- Foundation issues (auth, testing) need resolution before production email setup
