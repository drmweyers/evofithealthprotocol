## 📋 Story Overview

### Problem Statement
The Health Protocols tab needs to be removed from the Trainer dashboard as per business requirements. The trainer profile currently shows "Health Protocols" as a tab alongside "Customer Management", and this needs to be simplified to show only customer management functionality.

### Business Value
- Streamline trainer interface for better UX
- Focus trainers on core customer management features
- Reduce complexity and maintenance overhead
- Align with updated product strategy

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Health Protocols tab completely removed from Trainer dashboard
- [ ] No broken routes or imports related to health protocols
- [ ] Customer Management remains fully functional
- [ ] All related components and routes cleaned up
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Tests updated to reflect the change

---

## 🏗️ Technical Context

### Current Implementation
- **Location:** `client/src/pages/Trainer.tsx`
- **Current tabs:** Health Protocols (default) and Customer Management
- **Routing:** `/trainer/health-protocols` and `/trainer/customers`
- **Component:** `TrainerHealthProtocols` imported and used

### Files to Modify
1. `client/src/pages/Trainer.tsx` - Remove tab and related logic
2. Router configuration - Remove health protocol routes
3. Component imports - Clean up unused imports
4. Test files - Update to reflect removed functionality

### Dependencies
- React Router (wouter)
- Tabs component from shadcn/ui
- TrainerHealthProtocols component (to be removed from imports)

---

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Step 1: Remove Health Protocols Tab
- Remove the health-protocols TabsTrigger from the Tabs component
- Remove the health-protocols TabsContent section
- Update the grid-cols-2 to single column or adjust as needed
- Set customers as the default and only tab

### Step 2: Clean Up Routing Logic
- Remove health-protocols case from handleTabChange function
- Remove health-protocols from getActiveTab function
- Update default tab to 'customers'
- Remove any references to `/trainer/health-protocols` route

### Step 3: Remove Component Import
- Remove `import TrainerHealthProtocols from "../components/TrainerHealthProtocols"`
- Ensure no other files are importing this if it's being deprecated

### Step 4: Update Welcome Message
- Update the welcome message to reflect customer management focus
- Change from "Create and manage health protocols" to appropriate message

### Step 5: Update Stats Cards (if needed)
- Review if "Active Protocols" and "Protocol Assignments" stats are still relevant
- Consider replacing with customer-focused metrics

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/trainer` route
2. Verify only Customer Management functionality is visible
3. Check that no health protocols tab appears
4. Ensure no console errors
5. Test all customer management features work correctly

### Automated Testing with Playwright
```javascript
test('trainer dashboard should not have health protocols tab', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login as trainer
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('input[type="email"]', 'trainer@test.com');
  await page.fill('input[type="password"]', 'password');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  
  // Navigate to trainer dashboard
  await page.waitForURL('/trainer/**');
  
  // Verify health protocols tab doesn't exist
  await expect(page.locator('text="Health Protocols"')).not.toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('text="Protocols"')).not.toBeVisible();
  
  // Verify customer management is present
  await expect(page.locator('text="Customer Management"')).toBeVisible();
});
```
