4. **Monitor:** Wait 3-5 minutes for completion
5. **Verify:** Test at https://evofitmeals.com

#### Option 2: Docker Build and Push (15+ minutes)
```bash
# If you prefer Docker approach:
docker build --target prod -t fitnessmealplanner:prod .
docker tag fitnessmealplanner:prod registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod

```
