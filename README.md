## Running the Project with Docker

This project uses Docker for consistent development and production environments. We provide separate profiles for development and production use.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- Docker Compose v2.0 or higher
- Node.js 18+ (for running setup scripts)

### Quick Start - Development Environment

1. **Ensure Docker is running:**
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Start the development environment:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose --profile dev up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:4000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:4000/api
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

### Development Environment Details

The development setup includes:
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Automatically configured with the app
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Changes to code are reflected immediately
- **Volume Mounts**: Your local code is mounted into the container
- **Automatic DB Migration**: Database schema is automatically updated on startup

### Service Ports
- **Development:**
  - Combined Frontend/Backend: Port **4000**
  - PostgreSQL Database: Port **5432**
  - HMR WebSocket: Port **24678**
- **Production:**
  - Application: Port **5001**
  - PostgreSQL: Port **5432**

### Common Docker Commands

```sh
# Start development environment
docker-compose --profile dev up -d

# Stop development environment
docker-compose --profile dev down

# View logs
docker logs fitnessmealplanner-dev -f

# Restart containers
docker-compose --profile dev restart

# Rebuild after dependency changes
docker-compose --profile dev up -d --build

# Start production environment
docker-compose --profile prod up -d
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/fitmeal

# JWT Secret (generate a secure random string)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Optional: Email configuration for invitations
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Import errors (@shared alias not found)**
- Solution: The vite.config.ts is already configured with proper aliases. If you encounter this issue, restart the Docker container.

**Issue: Cannot connect to database**
- Solution: Ensure the PostgreSQL container is running and healthy:
  ```sh
  docker ps | grep postgres
  ```

**Issue: Port already in use**
- Solution: Check if another service is using port 4000 or 5432:
  ```sh
  # Windows
  netstat -ano | findstr :4000
  # Linux/Mac
  lsof -i :4000
  ```

**Issue: Changes not reflecting**
- Solution: The development environment uses volume mounts. If changes aren't reflecting, restart the container:
  ```sh
  docker-compose --profile dev restart
  ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Always start Docker first** before beginning development
2. **Check container health** with `docker ps`
3. **Monitor logs** with `docker logs fitnessmealplanner-dev -f`
4. **Access the app** at http://localhost:4000

For production deployment, refer to `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.
