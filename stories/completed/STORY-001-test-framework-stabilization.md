# Story: Test Framework Stabilization - COMPLETED

**Story ID:** STORY-001  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Effort:** 3 days  
**Type:** Technical Debt  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Completion Date:** 2025-08-25

## Implementation Summary

Successfully consolidated test framework from conflicting Jest/Vitest setup to unified configuration:

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- **Framework Consolidation:** Standardized on Vitest + Playwright
- **Configuration Optimization:** 85% coverage thresholds, proper aliases
- **Script Updates:** Clean npm scripts for all test scenarios
- **Validation:** QA verified all acceptance criteria met

### ðŸŽ¯ Results Achieved
- Single test runner (Vitest) for unit/integration tests
- Separate E2E configuration (Playwright) 
- 85%+ coverage reporting with v8 provider
- Developer-friendly commands: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e`
- Zero configuration conflicts

### ðŸ“Š Quality Metrics
- **Test Commands:** All functional âœ…
- **Coverage Reporting:** Working with 85% thresholds âœ…  
- **Type Safety:** Framework imports resolved âœ…
- **Developer Experience:** Clear, simple commands âœ…

## Acceptance Criteria - ALL MET âœ…

- [x] Remove all Jest configurations and dependencies
- [x] Configure Vitest for unit and integration tests  
- [x] Configure Playwright for E2E tests only
- [x] Update all import statements in test files
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors in test files
- [x] Generate test coverage report showing 85%+ coverage
- [x] All developers can run tests locally without errors

## Technical Implementation

### Final Configuration Files

**vitest.config.ts:**
- 85% coverage thresholds (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- Path aliases: @client, @server, @shared, @test
- Proper includes/excludes for unit + integration tests
- v8 coverage provider with HTML/JSON reporting

**playwright.config.ts:**  
- Streamlined E2E-only configuration
- Single Chromium project for core testing
- Test directory: `./test/e2e`
- Base URL: http://localhost:3500

**package.json scripts:**
```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:run": "vitest run", 
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:all": "npm run test:run && npm run test:e2e"
}
```

## Impact on Development Workflow

### Before (Problems)
- Multiple conflicting test frameworks
- Configuration errors blocking CI/CD
- Inconsistent coverage reporting
- Developer confusion about test commands

### After (Solutions)
- Single, clear test framework
- Reliable test execution
- Consistent 85% coverage standards
- Simple developer commands
