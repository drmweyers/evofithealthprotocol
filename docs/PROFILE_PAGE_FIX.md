# Profile Page Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
**Date:** 2025-08-04
**Component:** TrainerProfile.tsx
**Error:** `Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'profile' before initialization`

## Root Cause
The TrainerProfile component had a `useEffect` hook that was trying to access the `profile` variable before it was defined by the `useQuery` hook. This created a temporal dead zone (TDZ) error in JavaScript.

### Problematic Code (lines 86-95):
```javascript
// Debug logging for component state
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    console.log('TrainerProfile: Component rendered with:', {
      user: user,
      profile: profile,        // ERROR: 'profile' accessed before initialization
      profilePicture: profile?.profilePicture
    });
  }
}, [user, profile]);

// 'profile' is only defined here, AFTER the useEffect above
const { data: profile, isLoading: profileLoading } = useQuery<TrainerProfile>({
  // ...
});
```

## Solution
Removed the problematic `useEffect` that was trying to access `profile` before its definition. The debugging functionality is preserved in a different `useEffect` that runs after `profile` is properly defined.

### Fix Applied:
1. **Removed lines 86-95** - The debug useEffect that referenced `profile` before initialization
2. **Changed API endpoint** - Updated from `/api/profile` to `/api/auth/profile` to get the correct extended profile data
3. **Kept the valid debug useEffect** (lines 110-115) that properly references `profile` after it's defined

## Additional Steps Taken
1. Restarted the Docker container to ensure the changes were loaded
2. Required a hard browser refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cached JavaScript

## Prevention Tips
1. **Variable Declaration Order**: Always ensure variables are declared before they're used in React hooks
2. **useQuery Returns**: Remember that `useQuery` returns an object with `data` property, not the data directly
3. **Development Debugging**: Place debug hooks after all variable declarations to avoid TDZ errors

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Profile page loads without errors for Trainer role
- [x] Profile data displays correctly (bio, specializations, certifications)
- [x] Profile image upload functionality works
- [x] Edit profile functionality works
- [ ] Test with Admin role
- [ ] Test with Customer role

## Related Files
- `client/src/pages/TrainerProfile.tsx` - Main component file
- `server/authRoutes.ts` - Contains the `/api/auth/profile` endpoint
- `server/routes/profileRoutes.ts` - Contains the `/api/profile` endpoint (basic data only)

## Key Learning
In React components, the order of hooks matters. Variables defined by hooks like `useQuery` are not available until after the hook executes, so any code that references these variables must come after the hook declaration.
