## Database State We Created

### Protocol Assignments Created
```sql
-- 4 customers linked to trainer
customer.test@evofitmeals.com → trainer.test@evofitmeals.com
demo@test.com → trainer.test@evofitmeals.com
testuser@demo.com → trainer.test@evofitmeals.com
customer@demo.com → trainer.test@evofitmeals.com
```

### Tables Modified
- `protocol_assignments` - Added 4 records
- `trainer_health_protocols` - Added 1 test protocol
- `trainer_customer_relationships` - Added 4 relationships

## Code Changes Made

### 1. TrainerHealthProtocols.tsx
**Location:** `client/src/components/TrainerHealthProtocols.tsx`
**Change:** Added Dialog wrapper around ProtocolWizardEnhanced
**Status:** May not be the actual fix needed

### 2. No changes to ProtocolWizardEnhanced.tsx
**Location:** `client/src/components/protocol-wizard/ProtocolWizardEnhanced.tsx`
**Status:** Original code unchanged - might be where real issue is

## What Tests Check vs What User Needs

### Tests Check:
- Dialog appears (count > 0)
- Elements are visible
- Buttons can be clicked
- Text content exists

### Tests DON'T Check:
- Actual user workflow
- Visual appearance
- JavaScript errors
- State management issues
- API authentication problems
- Component mounting errors

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Get Specific Error Details
```bash
# User should run this and share output:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Clear console
4. Click "Open Protocol Wizard"
5. Screenshot or copy ANY errors shown
```

### 2. Check Network Tab
```bash
1. Open DevTools Network tab
2. Clear network log
3. Click "Open Protocol Wizard"
4. Look for any red (failed) requests
5. Check response of /api/trainer/customers
6. Check response of /api/protocol-templates
```

### 3. Verify Component Mounting
Need to add debug logging to see if component even mounts:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🚨 WIZARD MOUNTED - If you see this, component loaded');
  console.log('Props received:', { onComplete, onCancel });
  console.log('User context:', user);
}, []);
```

## Files to Check First

1. **Browser Console** - For JavaScript errors
2. **Network Tab** - For failed API calls
3. **React DevTools** - To see if component is in tree
4. **Server Logs** - For backend errors
5. **Docker Logs** - For container issues

## Possible Real Issues

### Frontend Issues
- [ ] React component crash
- [ ] Missing import/dependency
- [ ] CSS making it invisible
- [ ] Z-index issues
- [ ] Modal not mounting
- [ ] State not updating

### Backend Issues
- [ ] API authentication failing
- [ ] Database connection issues
- [ ] Missing environment variables
- [ ] CORS problems
- [ ] Session/cookie issues

### Environment Issues
- [ ] npm packages not installed
- [ ] Build not updated
- [ ] Cache issues
- [ ] Port conflicts
- [ ] Docker not running

## Truth
**We don't actually know what's broken because we haven't seen the real error yet.**

Tests passing means our test environment works, but the user's actual environment has a different issue we haven't identified.
