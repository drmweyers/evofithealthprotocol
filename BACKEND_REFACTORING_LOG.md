## Summary

### Completed Backend Refactoring
**Total Files Modified:** 8 major backend files
**Total Files Removed:** 9 meal plan/recipe service and route files

### Key Achievements:
1. **Database Schema:** Completely cleaned of meal plan tables and types
2. **API Routes:** All meal plan endpoints removed and replaced with health protocol endpoints
3. **Business Logic:** Meal plan generation replaced with health protocol generation
4. **AI Integration:** OpenAI service now generates health protocols instead of meal plans
5. **User Management:** Updated to work with protocol assignments instead of meal plans
6. **Progress Tracking:** Enhanced with comprehensive health protocol progress tracking

### Preserved Functionality:
- âœ… User authentication and authorization
- âœ… Trainer-customer relationships
- âœ… Progress measurements and photos
- âœ… Customer goals and milestones
- âœ… PDF generation capabilities (will be adapted for protocols)
- âœ… Customer invitation system

### New Health Protocol Features:
- ðŸ†• AI-powered health protocol generation
- ðŸ†• Natural language protocol creation
- ðŸ†• Protocol assignment and tracking
- ðŸ†• Protocol interaction analysis for safety
- ðŸ†• Comprehensive protocol progress monitoring
- ðŸ†• Educational content generation for protocols

## Verification Checklist

### After Each Phase:
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Health protocol endpoints still work
- [ ] User authentication still functions
- [ ] Progress tracking still works
- [ ] No import errors or missing dependencies

### Final Verification:
- [ ] Docker containers start successfully
- [ ] Health protocol creation works
- [ ] Protocol assignment works
- [ ] PDF generation works for protocols (not meal plans)
- [ ] All meal plan endpoints return 404 or are removed
- [ ] Database schema is clean

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy:
- Git commit before each major change
- Test after each phase
- Keep migration scripts for rollback if needed

### Testing Strategy:
- Verify core health protocol functionality after each change
- Check that authentication still works
- Ensure trainer-customer relationships are preserved
