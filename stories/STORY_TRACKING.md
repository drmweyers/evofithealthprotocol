## BMAD Workflow Process

### 1. Story Creation (Scrum Master)
```bash
# Command used by SM to create story
/create-next-story
# or
/create-story --task="Task description from backlog"
```

### 2. Development Phase (Developer)
```bash
# Developer picks up story
/dev
"I'll work on the current story"

# Developer implements following story details
# All context is in the story file
```

### 3. Quality Assurance (QA Agent)
```bash
# QA validates implementation
/qa
"Validate the current story implementation"

# QA checks against acceptance criteria
# Reports any issues back to developer
```

### 4. Story Completion
```bash
# SM marks story complete
/sm
"Mark STORY-001 as complete and move to next story"

# Story moves to completed folder
# Next story becomes current
```
